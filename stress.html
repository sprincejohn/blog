							<p style="text-align:justify">Stress is your body's response to certain situations. It’s subjective, so something that is stressful for you may 
							not be stressful for someone else. There are many different kinds of stress and not all of them are bad. Stress can help you act 
							quickly in an emergency or help you meet a deadline.
							<br><br>
							Stress can affect your physical and mental health, and your behavior. Your body responds to stress by producing chemicals and 
							hormones to help you rise to the challenge. Your heart rate increases, your brain works faster, and you have a sudden burst of energy. 
							This response is basic and natural and is what kept our ancestors from falling victim to hungry predators. But too much stress can have harmful effects. 
							It’s impossible to completely eliminate bad stress from your life, but you can learn to avoid and manage it.</p>

							<h3> Is all stress bad? </h3>
							<p>Not all stress is bad. In fact, some stress heightens your senses, helping you to avoid accidents, 
							power through unexpected deadlines, or stay clear-minded<br>
							But stress is meant to be temporary. Your body should return to a natural state after the situation has passed. 
							Your heart rate should slow, your muscles should relax, and your breathing should return to normal.</p>

						<!--TYPES OF STRESS-->

						<h2 id="H2"><u> </u></h2>

						<h3>The following are the two major types of STRESS:</h3>

						<br>
						<!--ACUTE STRESS-->

						<img src="image\student stress.jpg"style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px;"width="240"height="170"border=1px solid black><h2>1.Acute Stress.</h2>
						<p> Acute stress is the most common type of stress. It’s your body's immediate reaction to a new challenge, event, 
						or demand, and it triggers your fight-or-flight response. <a href="acute.html">Read more...</a></p>

						<p style="clear: both;">
					
						<!--CHRONIC STRESS-->
				
						<br><br>
     
						<img src="image\chronicc.jpg"style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px;"width="240"height="170"border=1px solid black><h2>2.Chronic Stress.</h2>
						<p>If acute stress isn't resolved and begins to increase or lasts for long periods of time.<a href="chronic.html">Read more..</a></p>
						<br><p style="clear: both;"><br><br>
											
						<p>And many more... When acute stress happens frequently, it’s called episodic acute stress. People who always seem to be having a crisis tend to 
						have episodic acute stress. They are often short-tempered, irritable, and anxious. People who are “worry warts” or pessimistic or who tend to see 
						the negative side of everything also tend to have episodic acute stress.
						Negative health effects are persistent in people with episodic acute stress. It may be hard for people with this type of stress to change their lifestyle, 
						as they accept stress as a part of life.</p>

							<h2  style="text-align:left"><u>Managing Stress</u></h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify">Stress affects each person differently. Some people may get headaches or stomachaches, while others may 
							lose sleep or get depressed or angry. People under constant stress may also get sick a lot. Managing stress is important to staying healthy. <br><br>
							It’s impossible to completely get rid of stress. The goal of stress management is to identify your stressors, which are the things that 
							cause you the most problems or demand the most of your energy. In doing so, you can overcome the negative stress those things induce. </p>

							But too much stress is unhealthy. There are many types of stress, from minor incidents that last a little while,
